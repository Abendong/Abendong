-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ayaba Abendong, a dynamic and contemporary scientist with a background in hydrogeology, environmental engineering, and data analysis. I have a deep passion for data analytics, sustainability, and the environment. I am a serial problem solver with the bliss of tackling complex challenges head-on. I possess exceptional communication skills and I am more productive in a collaborative environment. 

My expertise spans from gathering and web scraping, manipulation, and visualization of data to deduce actionable insights as well as performing life cycle assessments for products to foster sustainability. In addition to my technical skills, I am well-equipped with knowledge of circular business models, government policies, stakeholder roles, and sustainable business changes.

Picture speaks louder than words is what I go by. With the advent of incredible analytics tools, more stories can be told out of data. therefore  strive to use state-of-the-art tools to let my analysis and visuals speak for themselves. 

ðŸ§© When you don't find me making sense of data, you can find me pursuing my hobbies in fashion design. puzzle-solving with Lego is what I equally love doing.

ðŸ“šCurrently, I am sharpening and improving my skills in analytics in line with sustainability  and am eager to explore new opportunities to apply my talents.
Feel free to reach out to me via email at sirayaben@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/abendong.

Let's collaborate and solve problems together!
